# Micro Pico Firmware
## About Micro Pico
Micro pico offers a more simple take on programming the Pico W, it gives the user an easy to understand variety of commands, functions and more to work efficiently.
## Supported devices
Unfortunately the Micro Pico code only supports the [Pico W](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-w?variant=40059369619539) (no sponsored or endorsed)
I would potentially try to intergate older devices in the future!
